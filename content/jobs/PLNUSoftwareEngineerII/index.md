- Led development of an AI-driven Slack chatbot to solve knowledge discovery challenges across the department by enabling conversational access to TeamDynamix knowledge base content. Built using AWS Bedrock and other AI tools, the solution improved self-service rates and significantly reduced repetitive support inquiries.
- Enabled managers and CIOs to efficiently review and take action on requests directly within Slack by designing and implementing a Slack-based change request approval system that streamlines a previously email-driven process, reducing approval turnaround time significantly. Built on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, CDK) and integrated with TeamDynamix.
